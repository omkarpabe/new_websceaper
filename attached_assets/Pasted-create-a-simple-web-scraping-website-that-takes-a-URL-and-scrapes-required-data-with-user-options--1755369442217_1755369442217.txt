create a  simple web scraping website that takes a URL and scrapes required data with user options. 

First, you should consider the main components needed for a web scraping website. The user probably wants a frontend where they can input a URL and select what data to scrape, and a backend to handle the scraping logic.

you will need to decide on the tech stack. Since it's a simple project, using Node.js with Express for the backend and plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend makes sense. For web scraping, I can use libraries like Cheerio or Puppeteer.

Next, I should outline the features. The user mentioned giving some options, so I need to think about what those could be. Common scraping options include extracting titles, links, images, or specific elements by class or ID.

I should also consider how to structure the project. Maybe have an index.html for the frontend, a server.js for the backend, and separate directories for public assets like CSS and JS.

Error handling is important too. The website should handle invalid URLs and cases where scraping fails. Also, rate limiting might be necessary to avoid overwhelming target sites.

you should present this plan to the user using plan_mode_respond, making sure to include all these considerations and ask if they have any specific preferences or additional requirements.

Here's a proposed plan for the web scraping website:

1. __Tech Stack__

   - Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
   - Backend: Node.js/Express
   - Scraping: Cheerio (for static content) or Puppeteer (for dynamic content)

2. __Core Features__

   - URL input field with validation

   - Scraping options:

     - Extract page title
     - Extract all links
     - Extract images
     - Custom CSS selector input

   - Results display area with:

     - Raw data output
     - Option to download as JSON/CSV

3. __Project Structure__

   ```javascript
   /scraper-site
     ├── public/
     │   ├── css/
     │   ├── js/
     ├── views/
     │   └── index.html
     └── server.js
   ```

4. __Implementation Steps__

   - Setup basic Express server
   - Create frontend interface
   - Implement scraping endpoints
   - Add error handling
   - Add rate limiting (1 request/5 seconds)

5. __Advanced Considerations__

   - Proxy support to avoid IP blocking
